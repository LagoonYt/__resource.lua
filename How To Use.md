First you will want to do as you normally do and create the car pack.

Make sure you have created the data folder and put all of the vehicles folder in there first with the spawn code as the name.

Now open up the executable!

Next it will open up windows warning. This is default as i am not a trusted creator (as this is my first executable file).

Once you have ran properly,

There will be a set of instructions. These should be:
  Click anywhere!
  Open car packs folder!
  resource.lua should be created in folder.
  
  
  
  
In more detail click the grey box.

Find the directory of the carpack.

Wthin the car pack folder you should see data and stream folder.

Dont do anything with those. Its just to make sure you have the correct folder.

The __resource.lua should be created there ready for use.

If the resource was not created in the correct folder you have either not clicked on the car packs name or there has been an error.

If resource.lua is not created at all ask for help at my discord Scrappy#9439
